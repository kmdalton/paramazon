Fix this fucking LuaSocket issue on Docker image
- Seems like v2.0.2-x has an issue Lua 5.1? something about luaL_object or something, need to reproduce
- I don't see this error on my machine and I think I have all the same package versions, WTF
- Could try to roll my own Docker image for OpenResty, using a Debian base, but I'm not sure that'd help
- Could take socket.http.request out of affiliate_request, rewrite using ngx.socket.tcp
Or, scrap Docker until it hits 1.0
- Spin up a new Digital Ocean droplet and run scripts
